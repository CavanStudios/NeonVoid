## 📚 Learning Git & GitHub

Use the flashcards (`git-github-flashcards.html`) to learn:
- **Concepts**: What is Git? What is GitHub? What's the difference?
- **Commands**: git add, git commit, git push, git pull, etc.
- **GitHub Features**: Pull Requests, Issues, Forks
- **Workflows**: Daily use, starting new projects, creating branches

Study tip: Go through all cards once, then filter to just "commands" and practice those in your terminal.

## 🎨 Creating Custom Pages

Use the UI Template Kit to create:
- Character profile pages
- Faction overviews  
- Location descriptions
- Timeline visualizations
- Anything else for your world

The components work together - combine cards, buttons, badges, and panels however you need.

## ❓ Git vs GitHub - Quick Answer

**Git** = Version control software on your computer (tracks changes to files)
**GitHub** = Cloud platform for hosting Git repositories (like Google Drive for code)

Think: Git is Microsoft Word, GitHub is Google Docs

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

**GitHub not updating?**

git commit -m "Your message"
git push            # Upload to GitHub
```

**Want to try something without breaking things?**
```bash
git checkout -b experiment    # Create a branch
# [Make your changes]
git checkout main             # Go back to main
```

**Made a mistake?**
- Check the flashcards for "undo" commands
