# Technology - Dark Void World Bible

## Overview

Technology in Dark Void follows realistic near-future trajectories (2030-2080 timeline). No faster-than-light travel, no artificial gravity beyond rotation, no magic solutions. The corporations control technological advancement through patents, infrastructure monopolies, and proprietary systems that create technological lock-in.

The horror isn't the technology itself - it's who controls it and what they do with it.

## Biotech & Enhancement

### Neural Interfaces

**Current State (2030s-2040s):**
Brain-computer interfaces like Neuralink's N1 implant are entering widespread use. Direct neural communication, sensory augmentation, and memory enhancement are becoming standard for corporate employees.

**Capabilities:**
- **Subvocal communication**: Thought-to-text without speaking. Silent commands to devices. Internal corporate messaging that leaves no audio trace.
- **Sensory augmentation**: Enhanced vision spectrums (infrared, UV), expanded audio range, proprioceptive feedback for machinery operation
- **Memory augmentation**: External storage linked to biological memory. Instant recall of corporate data, procedures, meeting notes. "Skill downloads" for specific corporate functions.
- **Monitoring capabilities**: Real-time tracking of stress levels, emotional states, attention metrics, compliance indicators

**Legacy Dynamics Applications:**
Neural interfaces are Legacy's primary product line. Every employee gets basic productivity suites. Higher-tier employees get cognitive enhancements. Executives get full integration.

The monitoring is the real product. Every heartbeat, every stress spike, every moment of distraction - all harvested data. Your own nervous system reports to HR.

**Cora's Augmentation:**
Cora's neural interface is military-grade, far beyond civilian models. Combat reflex enhancement, threat assessment systems, direct weapon integration. But also: emotion regulation protocols, compliance conditioning, loyalty reinforcement.

The Corp didn't just enhance her capabilities - they restructured how she thinks. The syntax of command replacing the syntax of love isn't metaphor. It's literally what they did to her brain.

**Dark Void Implications:**
- Mandatory "productivity enhancers" that also monitor thoughts and emotional states
- Corporate control via neural kill switches and override protocols
- Workers becoming literally incompatible with competitor systems (vendor lock-in at the neurological level)
- Black market neural mods and jailbreaking culture among rebels

---

### Genetic Modifications

**Current Developments:**
CRISPR and gene therapy advancing rapidly. By 2040s-2050s, genetic enhancement is routine for those who can afford it.

**Capabilities:**
- **Disease resistance**: Engineered immunity to common illnesses, optimized immune response, cancer resistance
- **Performance optimization**: Enhanced muscle efficiency, improved oxygen utilization, cognitive processing speed increases
- **Longevity treatments**: Telomere extension, cellular repair mechanisms, potentially 150+ year lifespans for the wealthy
- **Adaptation modifications**: Low-gravity physiology for orbital workers, radiation resistance for space crews, atmospheric tolerance for terraform colonies

**Legacy Dynamics Applications:**
Genetic branding. Every long-term employee gets "optimization packages" - modifications that carry Legacy's proprietary markers. Your DNA becomes corporate property. Your children inherit corporate code.

The class stratification is biological: "Natural" humans vs. enhanced corporate employees. Genetic discrimination is legal because it's "just" corporate preference for employees with "compatible enhancements."

**Cora's Genetics:**
Cora's extraordinary cyberware affinity is genetic - her nervous system was naturally optimized for neural integration. One in ten million. The stolen genetic data TBD holds is valuable because it's the map to creating more people like her.

Edwin carries the same genes. He doesn't know. TBD watches him with protection and temptation intertwined.

**Dark Void Implications:**
- Enhancement packages as corporate "benefits" that create biological dependency
- Genetic markers as corporate branding (you're literally Legacy Dynamics, coded into every cell)
- Subscription model genetics (your enhancements need periodic "renewals")
- Children born with corporate genetic signatures
- The weaponization of Cora required both her natural genetics AND twenty years of brutal augmentation - you can't just clone her results

## Space Habitats & Living Spaces

### Orbital Stations

**Construction Methods:**
Building on International Space Station technology with commercial scaling. By 2035-2050, permanent orbital populations.

**Design Approaches:**
- **Rotating habitats**: O'Neill cylinders or Stanford torus designs creating artificial gravity through rotation (1-2 RPM for comfort). Size determines population - small stations house hundreds, large installations support thousands.
- **Modular construction**: 3D-printed components using asteroid-mined materials. Self-assembling structures with AI-guided assembly. Expandable as needed.
- **Closed-loop life support**: Biosphere systems with hydroponic farms, water recycling at 95%+ efficiency, atmospheric processing. Renewable but not perfect - supplies still needed from planetside.
- **Radiation shielding**: Water tanks serving double duty (storage + radiation barrier), polyethylene layers, potentially electromagnetic deflectors for solar wind

**Corporate Control:**
Stations are company towns in the sky. HydrUS runs water processing. Legacy provides medical. Uplink controls communications. You can't leave - you owe transport debt. You can't protest - they control your air.

The Drift exists in this context - one of the rare independent stations, constantly struggling to maintain life support without corporate infrastructure.

**Dark Void Implications:**
- Station architecture reflects corporate hierarchy (executive levels have windows and 1g rotation, worker levels are cramped zero-g can-habitats)
- Life support as control mechanism (ration air, water, heat as punishment)
- Indentured labor contracts to pay off "transport debt"
- Station security = corporate security

---

### Lunar & Mars Colonies

**Settlement Strategies:**
Permanent surface and subsurface colonies using in-situ resource utilization (ISRU).

**Infrastructure:**
- **Lava tubes**: Natural underground caverns providing radiation shielding and stable temperatures. Prime real estate.
- **Regolith construction**: Sintered lunar/Martian soil for building materials. 3D-printed habitats using local resources.
- **Ice mining**: Water extraction from polar regions for life support and fuel production (electrolysis to hydrogen/oxygen for rocket propellant)
- **Greenhouse domes**: Pressurized agricultural zones with genetically modified crops optimized for low-light, low-gravity conditions
- **Transit infrastructure**: Maglev surface transport, orbital shuttles, resource pipelines

**Corporate Territories:**
The Moon and Mars aren't unified governments - they're patchworks of corporate claims. Legacy's medical research facilities in Shackleton Crater. HydrUS's ice mining operations at Korolev. Uplink's relay stations on the peaks of eternal light.

Wellspring Colony is the model HydrUS wants to replicate everywhere - a water-rich moon fully controlled, workers paid in scrip, paradise for visitors and prison for residents.

**Dark Void Implications:**
- Colonies as company towns - generations born, working, dying under one logo
- Strategic resource control (water, oxygen, rare earth minerals)
- Workers can't just "leave" - space is hostile, transport is expensive, debt is eternal
- TBD's controlled system likely includes one of these colonies - their responsibility, their burden

## Propulsion & Spacecraft

### Nuclear Propulsion (Most Realistic Near-Term)

**Nuclear Thermal Rockets (NTR):**
- Reactor heats propellant (hydrogen), expelled for thrust
- 2x efficiency of chemical rockets
- Mars in 3-4 months vs. 6-9 months chemical
- Development timeline: Testing 2030s, operational 2040s
- Limitation: Still need propellant mass

**Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP):**
- Reactor powers ion drives or plasma thrusters
- Extremely efficient for cargo hauling
- Slow acceleration but massive delta-v capability
- Constant low thrust over months = high final velocity
- Perfect for bulk haulers that don't care about time

**Dark Void Applications:**
Personnel shuttles use NTR for faster transit. Bulk cargo uses NEP for efficiency. The fusion drives TBD mentions in context of HydrUS manufacturing them aren't widespread yet - still experimental, incredibly expensive, controlled technology.

---

### Ion & Plasma Drives

**Current Technology:**
Ion drives already used (Dawn spacecraft). Scaling up for crewed vessels by 2040s.

**Systems:**
- **VASIMR** (Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket): Plasma heated by radio waves, magnetic nozzle. Adjustable thrust/efficiency ratio.
- **Hall effect thrusters**: Proven technology, improving efficiency. Could reach 0.01g continuous thrust with enough power.
- **Performance**: Earth to Mars in 39 days with sufficient power (nuclear reactor or fusion). Asteroid belt accessible with extended burns.

**Limitations:**
Low thrust requires long burn times. Can't launch from planetary surface. Need chemical rockets or NEP to achieve orbit first. But once in space, incredibly efficient.

**Dark Void Applications:**
Most common drive system for ships that don't need speed. Cheaper than nuclear, more accessible than fusion. TBD's ships probably use advanced ion drives - reliable, maintainable, good enough.

---

### Laser & Beamed Energy Propulsion

**Laser-Thermal Propulsion:**
- Ground/orbital laser arrays heat onboard propellant
- No reactor needed on ship (lower mass, higher efficiency)
- Requires infrastructure network of laser stations
- Only works within range of stations

**Laser Sails:**
- Ultra-thin reflective sails pushed by laser beams
- Potential for 0.2c (20% light speed) with massive infrastructure investment
- Acceleration phase requires years-long laser push
- Deceleration is the real problem (no laser at destination)

**Microwave Beaming:**
- Power transmission to spacecraft
- Enables high-thrust electric drives without heavy reactors
- Requires receiver arrays on ships

**Corporate Infrastructure:**
Uplink operates the laser-sail network and microwave beaming stations. You need their "permission packet" to access beam-pushing infrastructure. Speed and range directly correlate to corporate affiliation.

Pirates and independents stuck with slower chemical or early ion tech. Fast ships are a privilege, not a right.

**Dark Void Implications:**
- Propulsion infrastructure as control mechanism
- Access to fast travel = corporate loyalty required
- Rebels and independents perpetually slower, disadvantaged
- Critical infrastructure vulnerable to sabotage (Waveborn targeting relay stations)

---

### Realistic Spacecraft Design

**Physics Constraints:**
No artificial gravity except rotation. No inertial dampeners. Acceleration = force on crew. Long transits require rotating habitat sections or acceptance of zero-g health issues.

**Ship Architecture:**
- **Torch ships**: Constant low acceleration (0.01-0.1g). Crew experiences sustained "gravity" via thrust. Rotating sections for coast phases.
- **Cycler ships**: Aldrin cyclers for Earth-Mars routes. Permanent orbital infrastructure. Small shuttles rendezvous. Fuel-efficient.
- **Tethered rotation**: Two modules connected by cable, spinning for artificial gravity. Separate when maneuvering needed.
- **Radiation shielding**: Water tanks, polyethylene layers, potentially electromagnetic deflectors. Always a concern.

**Ship Classes by Function:**
- **Personnel shuttles**: Fast, 0.05-0.1g capable, rotating sections. 30-90 day transit times. Expensive.
- **Bulk haulers**: Slow ion tugs, 0.001g constant thrust. Months-long trajectories but massive cargo capacity. Cheap per ton.
- **Mining drones**: Autonomous, AI-piloted. Solar-electric for inner system, radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) for outer asteroids.
- **Defense/enforcement**: Missile platforms, laser point-defense, kinetic kill vehicles. Space combat is long-range missiles and point-defense, not dogfights.

**Corporate Branding:**
Ships visually reflect corporate identity:
- **HydrUS vessels**: Flowing organic curves (wave aesthetic), blue-teal livery
- **Legacy ships**: Brutal utilitarian blocks, gold-emerald accents
- **Uplink craft**: Sleek minimalism bristling with antennae, silver-white-black

Employee shuttles are cramped. Executive yachts have full 1g rotating rings. The ship you're on announces your status.

**Dark Void Implications:**
- Ship design as class marker
- Fast ships vs. slow ships = corporate vs. independent
- The Drift is probably a modified cargo hauler - sturdy, ugly, reliable
- Repo teams in fast-burn interceptors hunting defaulted ships
- Waveborn using stolen recon-class gravitation wave drives

## Physics & Energy Systems

### Fusion Power (The Holy Grail)

**Development Timeline:**
ITER proving tokamak concept now. Commercial fusion plants potentially 2045-2055 if development continues.

**Reactor Types:**
- **Tokamak reactors**: Magnetic confinement, deuterium-tritium fuel. Large installations.
- **Inertial confinement**: Laser fusion (NIF achieved ignition 2022). Potential for smaller, modular reactors.
- **Aneutronic fusion**: Proton-boron or deuterium-helium-3. Cleaner, much harder to achieve. Helium-3 requires lunar mining.

**Impact:**
Effectively unlimited energy. Enables massive orbital infrastructure, deep space missions, energy abundance. Also enables new weapons, new forms of control, new monopolies.

**Corporate Control:**
HydrUS manufactures fusion reactors (hydrogen fuel - on brand). They control helium-3 mining operations on the Moon. Legacy Dynamics holds patents on confinement systems. Fusion monopolies create energy monopolies.

**Dark Void Implications:**
- Fusion as corporate leverage (control the reactors, control civilization)
- Helium-3 mining as strategic resource (Moon becomes battleground)
- Energy abundance doesn't mean energy freedom (corporations still charge)
- TBD's system probably has fusion power (requisite for self-sufficiency) - where did they get it?

### Advanced Materials

**Graphene & Carbon Nanotubes:**
- 100x stronger than steel per weight
- Incredible electrical/thermal conductivity
- Applications: Space elevator tethers (maybe), ultra-light structures, advanced electronics
- Production scaling up 2030s-2040s

**Programmable Matter:**
- Materials that change properties on command
- Shape-memory alloys, electroactive polymers
- Applications: Adaptive armor, morphing structures, reconfigurable tools

**Room-Temperature Superconductors:**
- If achieved (big if), revolutionizes everything
- Zero-resistance power transmission
- Magnetic levitation without cooling
- Quantum computing at scale
- Currently theoretical/extremely high-pressure only

**Self-Healing Materials:**
- Polymers and composites that automatically repair damage
- Critical for long-duration space operations (can't get repairs easily)
- Bio-inspired systems, microcapsule healing agents

**Corporate Patents:**
Material science patents create technological lock-in. Only Legacy graphene works with Legacy implants. Only HydrUS polymer works with HydrUS water processing. Incompatibility is designed.

---

### Quantum Technologies

**Quantum Computing:**
- Already emerging in 2020s
- By 2040s: Breaking current encryption, simulating complex molecules, optimizing logistics
- Corporate/military exclusive for decades before civilian access

**Quantum Sensing:**
- Gravimeters detecting underground structures
- Ultra-precise navigation without GPS
- Medical imaging at molecular level
- Detecting stealth ships via gravitational disturbance

**Quantum Communication:**
- Unhackable encryption via entanglement
- Corporate secure channels
- Instantaneous key distribution (not faster-than-light data transmission)
- Strategic advantage in communications security

**Dark Void Implications:**
- Uplink controls quantum communication networks
- Encrypted corporate channels rebels can't intercept
- Navigation supremacy for those with quantum sensors
- Quantum computing as corporate advantage (break rebel encryption, optimize supply chains, predict market movements)

---

## Space Communications

### The Light-Speed Lag Problem (Fundamental Physics)

**Distances and Delays:**
- Earth to Moon: 1.3 seconds one-way
- Earth to Mars: 3-22 minutes one-way (depending on orbit)
- Earth to Jupiter: 35-52 minutes one-way
- Earth to Neptune: 4+ hours one-way
- No workaround: Information cannot travel faster than light

**Narrative Implications:**
This is the most important technological constraint in Dark Void. No real-time conversations across the solar system. No tactical coordination across planetary distances. Everything is asynchronous.

---

### Laser Communications

**Technology:**
- Optical links carrying data at 10-100 Gbps (vs radio's 10-100 Mbps)
- Tight beams = less interference, harder to intercept
- Requires precise pointing (especially over long distances)
- Already testing: NASA's LCRD operational 2023

**Infrastructure:**
- **Relay networks**: Orbital relay stations creating "optical mesh" across solar system
- **Adaptive optics**: Compensating for atmospheric distortion on planetary links
- **Backup radio**: Lower bandwidth but more forgiving pointing requirements
- **Emergency beacons**: Omnidirectional distress signals (everyone hears, low data rate)

**Corporate Control - Uplink's Monopoly:**
Uplink controls the relay network. They set prices, prioritize traffic, monitor content. Corporate messages fast-lane. Personal communications throttled. Communication blackouts as punishment.

Rival corporations can't coordinate without using Uplink infrastructure. Independent settlers get days-old news. If Uplink doesn't want you to communicate, you don't communicate.

---

### Living With Lag

**Communication Patterns:**
- **Asynchronous by default**: Messages, not calls. Video letters, not FaceTime.
- **Predictive AI assistants**: AI models of people respond instantly. Real person confirms/corrects later. Uncanny valley conversations.
- **Autonomous authority**: Local managers with decision-making power. Earth HQ sends strategic directives, not tactical commands.
- **Information markets**: Fresh data has value. Stale data is worthless. Speed premium on news.
- **Scheduled sync windows**: When ships/stations align for best transmission, everyone rushes to communicate
- **Batch communications**: Save up messages, send in bulk when bandwidth available

**Cultural Adaptations:**
People speak differently across distances. Short, clear messages. Context front-loaded. Assume nothing about shared immediate knowledge. "Time-capsule communication" - recording yourself for future playback, knowing response won't come for hours or days.

**Dark Void Implications:**
- Cora hunting TBD can't get real-time corporate support - she operates autonomously
- TBD's system can't call Earth for help - they're on their own
- Edwin talking to someone on Mars has to wait hours for response
- Strategic decisions made with outdated information
- AI proxies creating trust issues (is that really them, or algorithm prediction?)

**Uplink's Dark Power:**
Uplink doesn't just control the pipes - they control the perception of time itself. They can delay messages, claiming "solar interference." They can prioritize corporate traffic while telling independents "bandwidth limitations." They can read everything, adjust everything, memory-hole anything.

When Cora tells Edwin "Finish the story, son," that message might pass through a dozen Uplink relays. Each one logged. Each one analyzed. Each one potentially edited. How does he know it's really her words?

- Where did TBD get fusion technology for their system?
- Does Edwin have any augmentations? Is he "natural" in a world of enhanced humans?
- What is the Drift's propulsion system? How does it maintain independence?
- Are there "dead spots" outside Uplink's communication network where rebels can talk freely?
- What level of AI exists? Full sapience or narrow/specialized only?
- How common is automation vs. human labor? Why employ people if robots work?
- What is the state of Earth's environment? Ruined? Recovering? Corporate-controlled paradise?

---

## Design Philosophy

Technology in Dark Void is:
- **Grounded**: Based on real physics and current research trajectories
- **Controlled**: Monopolized by corporations as leverage
- **Unequal**: Creates and reinforces class hierarchies
- **Personal**: Affects characters intimately (neural implants, genetic markers, communication delays)
- **Constraining**: Sets narrative boundaries (no FTL, no magic gravity, no instant communication)
- **Thematically resonant**: Body modification parallels corporate ownership, communication lag parallels emotional distance, propulsion monopoly parallels freedom of movement

The tech isn't neutral. It's a weapon. And the corporations are using it.
