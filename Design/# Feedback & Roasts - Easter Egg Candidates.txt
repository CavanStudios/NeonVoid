## Implementation Categories

### Item Descriptions
Hidden flavor text on discoverable items.

```
Example:
Item Name: "Vintage Corporate Logo (Circa 2025)"
Description: "Critics said a 5-year-old could do better. 
             The artist upgraded their skills. 
             They're 6 now."
```

### Hoverable Tooltips
Easter eggs when players hover over certain UI elements or objects.

```
Example:
[Hover over a glitchy terminal]
"Error 5Y34R-OLD: Artistic integrity not found"
```

### Loading Screen Tips
Fake "tips" that are actually roasts.

```
Example:
"Pro tip: If the graphics look bad, squint harder."
"Fun fact: This loading screen took longer to make than the logo."
```

### NPC Dialogue
Characters reference the feedback in conversation.

```
Example:
Street Vendor: "I used to sell art, but some corpo said 
               my work looked like a child made it. 
               Now I sell weapons. Much better reviews."
```

### Collectible Dev Notes
Hidden "developer notes" players can find scattered around.

```
Example:
[Crumpled note in a trash can]
"Note to self: Logo feedback - 'looks like a 5 year old drew it'
 Action item: Find a talented 6 year old"
```

### Achievement Names
Achievements that reference development struggles.

```
Example:
Achievement: "Art School Dropout"
Description: "Discovered 10 pieces of 'child-like' art"

Achievement: "Constructive Criticism" 
Description: "Found all hidden developer roasts"
```

### Riptide Collective Specific
The Riptide Collective would LOVE roasting corporate stuff.

```
Example:
Riptide Hacker: "You see that HydrUS logo? My kid 
                could hack a better design. Actually, 
                she did. We use it for target practice."
```

## Rules for Inclusion

1. **Keep it fun** - Roasts should be playful, not mean-spirited
2. **Self-deprecating is great** - Laughing at ourselves is endearing
3. **Credit optional** - Can reference source anonymously or by name (with permission)
4. **Fits the world** - Should feel like it belongs in The Dark Void's universe
5. **Reward exploration** - Best ones should be hidden, not obvious

---

## How to Add New Entries

1. Log the original feedback exactly as received
2. Note the source (person, platform, etc.)
3. Brainstorm in-game implementation
4. Set status to "Idea"
5. Update status as it progresses
